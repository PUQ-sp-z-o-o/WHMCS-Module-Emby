    If you don't want any folder to be accessible, type "-".

### User Configuration:

- **Streaming bitrate limit:** An optional per-stream bitrate limit for all out of network devices. This is useful to prevent devices from requesting a higher bitrate than your internet connection can handle. This may result in increased CPU load on your server in order to transcode videos on the fly to a lower bitrate.
- **Remote control:** Remote control of shared devices (DLNA devices are considered shared until a user begins controlling them)
- **Media downloads:** Users can download media and store it on their devices. This is not the same as a sync feature. Book libraries require this enabled to function properly.
- **Username prefix/Username suffix:** Necessary in order to generate a username for the service, in the format: **prefix&lt;cliet\_id&gt;-&lt;service\_id&gt;suffix**

### Allow playback (Restricting access to transcoding may cause playback failures in clients due to unsupported media formats)

- **media**
- **audio that requires transcoding**
- **video that requires transcoding**
- **video that requires conversion without re-encoding**

### Feature access:

- **Allow Live TV access**
- **Allow Live TV recording management**
- **Force transcoding of remote media sources such as Live TV**
